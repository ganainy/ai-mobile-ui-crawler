# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! This project follows a concise set of engineering principles to keep code clean, robust, well-tested, and user-focused.

Please read our SPECKIT Engineering Principles before contributing:

- `.github/prompts/speckit.principles.md`

Those principles include a PR checklist, testing guidance, performance guidance, and rules for when to ask clarifying questions.

## Making a change
- Open an issue for non-trivial work or start a small focused branch for quick fixes.
- Keep changes small and focused. Large features should be broken into multiple PRs.
- Include tests for new behavior and regression tests for bugs fixed.
- Add screenshots or a short recording for UI changes.

## Pull Request checklist
When creating a PR, use the checklist in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to ensure reviews cover UX and performance expectations.

## Questions
If any requirement is unclear, ask in the issue or PR comments and document the answer in the PR.

Thanks — your contributions make this project better.
