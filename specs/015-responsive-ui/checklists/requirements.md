# Specification Quality Checklist: Responsive UI with Loading Indicators

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and testable
- Spec covers 6 user stories addressing all major blocking operations: run history loading, report generation, MobSF analysis, run deletion, device/app detection, and startup initialization
- Success criteria include measurable performance targets (100ms interaction time, 200ms loading indicator appearance, 95% user satisfaction)
- Edge cases cover concurrent operations, cancellation, application closure, network failures, and memory-intensive scenarios
